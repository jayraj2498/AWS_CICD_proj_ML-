## end to end ML project . 

### create env : - 
'''
conda create -p venv python==3.9 -y  
conda activate venv/
'''   

pip install -r .\requirements.txt  or 
 python .\setup.py install    

 setup.py it will install all library from requiremnet.txt  

 
# python -m src.components.data_ingestion  
# python -m src.exception 


 ### src 
 ''' create src folder  :  in the src folser entire lifecylce of ML project will run 

 in that folder 1st crete __init__.py file bcz : these thiswill alaways be a package and we should able to import it to somewhere == to use the functionality of programe everywhere   

# Project 

This project is a machine learning-based application for [brief description of what the application does]. It includes functionalities for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment using a web interface.

## Directory Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- `.gitignore`: File specifying intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- `notebooks/`: Directory containing Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training.
- `src/`: Directory containing the source code of the project.
  - `components/`: Directory containing modules related to data ingestion, data transformation, and model training.
  - `pipeline/`: Directory containing modules related to the training and prediction pipelines.
- `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates for web applications.
- `Dockerfile`: Configuration file for building Docker containers.
- `README.md`: Readme file containing information about the project.
- `app.py`: Python script serving as the entry point for the web application.
- `artifacts/`: Directory containing model artifacts (e.g., trained model, preprocessor), and CSV files for training and testing data.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing required Python packages for the project.
- `setup.py`: Setup script for packaging the project.
- `src/exception.py`: Python script defining custom exception classes.
- `src/logger.py`: Python script defining a logger for the project.
- `src/utils.py`: Python script containing utility functions.
- `templates/form.html`: HTML file defining a form for user input.
- `templates/index.html`: HTML file defining the main page of the web application.
- `templates/results.html`: HTML file displaying the results of model predictions.
